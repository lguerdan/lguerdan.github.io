  abstract={Predicting fluid intelligence based on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans poses several challenges, including developing an adequate data representation of three dimensional voxel data,extracting predictive information from this data representation, and de-vising  a  model  that  is  able  to  leverage  the  predictive  information.  We evaluate  two  strategies  for  prediction  of  fluid  intelligence  given  structural MRI scans acquired through the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study: deep learning models trained on raw imagery and  classical  machine  learning  models  trained  on  extracted  features.Our  best-performing  solution  consists  of  a  classical  machine  learning model trained on a combination of provided brain volume estimates and extracted  features.  Specifically,  a  Gradient  Boosting  Regressor  (GBR)trained on a PCA-reduced feature space produced the best performance(train  MSE  =  66.29,  validation  MSE  =  70.16),  surpassing  regression models trained on the provided volume data alone, and 2D/3D Convolutional Neural Networks trained on various representations of imagery data. Nonetheless, these results remain slightly better than a mean pre-diction, suggesting that neither approach is capturing a high degree of variance in the data}

  title={Extracting Motion-Related Subspaces from EEG in Mobile Brain/Body Imaging Studies},

  year={2019},

  abstract={Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) is an emerging non-invasive approach to investigate human brain activity and motor behavior associated with cognitive processes in natural conditions. MoBI studies and analyses pipelines com- bine brain measurements, e.g. Electroencephalography (EEG), with motion data as participants conduct tasks with near- natural behavior. Within the field however, standard source decomposition and reconstruction pipelines largely rely on unsupervised blind source separation (BSS) approaches and do not consider movement information to guide the decomposition of oscillatory brain sources. We propose the use of a super- vised spatial filtering method, Source Power Co-modulation (SPoC), for extracting source components that co-modulate with body motion. Further, we introduce a method to validate the quality of oscillatory sources in MoBI studies. We illustrate the approach to investigate the link between hand and head movement kinematics and power dynamics of EEG sources while participants explore an invisible maze in virtual reality. Stable oscillatory source envelopes correlating with hand and head motion were isolated in all subjects, with median ρ = .13 for all sources and median ρ = .16 for sources passing the selection criteria. The results indicate that it is possible to improve movement related source separation to further guide our understanding of how movement and brain dynamics interact.}
