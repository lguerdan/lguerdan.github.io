Hi, I'm Luke! I graduated from the University of Missouri with degrees in Computer Science and Psychology. While at MU, I worked under Dr. Yi Shang in the [Distributed and Intelligent Computing Lab](http://dslsrv1.rnet.missouri.edu/~shangy/){:target="_blank"}. Since graduating, I co-founded [TigerAware](http://tigeraware.com){:target="_blank"}, a platform for conducting mobile-based research studies. 

I am interested in developing collaborative intelligence – systems that combine human and machine strengths to solve interactive problems. My work blends techniques from machine learning, human–computer interaction, economics, and cognitive science.

I will begin an MPhil in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge starting October 2020 and hope to begin a PhD program in 2021. I am fortunate to have the support of an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and Barry Goldwater Scholarship.
