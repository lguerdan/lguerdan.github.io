I am an MPhil student in the [Computer Laboratory](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, where I study computer science and conduct research under Dr. Hatice Gunes in the [Affective Intelligence and Robotics Lab](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~hg410/people.html). I am broadly interested in research that improves human-machine collaboration through techniques spanning machine learning, human-robot interaction, economics, and cognitive science. 

Previously, I graduated from the University of Missouri with degrees in computer science and psychology. While at MU, I worked under Dr. Yi Shang in the [Distributed and Intelligent Computing Lab](http://dslsrv1.rnet.missouri.edu/~shangy/) and co-founded [TigerAware](https://tigeraware.com/), a platform for conducting mobile-based research studies.

I hope to begin a PhD program fall of 2021, and am fortunate to have the support of an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
